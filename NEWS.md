# demography v0.999 (30 July 2010)

These are now done using simulations which are much slower than what was done previously, but they are correct (unlike in previous versions). Set the argument PI=TRUE to compute prediction intervals.
- tfr rewritten to correct the computation of prediction intervals. These are now done using simulations which are much slower than what was done previously, but they are correct (unlike in previous versions). Set the argument PI=TRUE to compute prediction intervals.

# demography v0.992 (3 July 2008)

# demography v0.98

- Updated documentation to conform to new CRAN rules.
- Added population forecasting functions as described in Hyndman and Booth (2007).
- Modified the internals of smooth.demogdata to take account of changes in the R base and stats packages.
- A few bug fixes.

# demography v0.97

# demography v0.96

- smooth.demogdata slightly modified to give better results.
- Bug fixes in various functions.
- Smooth.demogdata handles age-??grouping better.
- Smooth.demogdata no longer crashes if all age groups have zero population in a year.

# demography v0.95

- Most data have now been taken out of the package (as it is now publicly available). The only data sets in the demography package are fr.mort (French mortality) and aus.fert (Australian fertility).
- The package now handles fertility, mortality and migration data. The basic data class is ?demogdata? and demogdata$type indicates the type of demographic data.
- Many functions have been revised to handle the new data structures. However, I?ve tried to keep the calling syntax the same. If existing code no longer works, check the help files first.
- fmm has been renamed as fdm as it now fits functional demographic models (and not only functional mortality models).
- read.mortality has been renamed as read.demogdata. Similarly, other functions of the form xxx.mortality are now called xxx.demogdata.
- smooth.demogdata now handles various types of smoothing and smoothing constraints. See the help file for details. It tries to do something appropriate depending on the type of data passed. At the moment, it only handles mortality and fertility data.
- I?ve added tfr to compute total fertility rates, and isfe to compute the Integrated Squared Forecast Error for different model orders.
- The documentation has been revised in many places, and several references added.
- All these changes have almost certainly introduced new errors
